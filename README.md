# JLPT N4/N5 Vocabulary

This repository provides two tools for reviewing Japanese vocabulary:

- **Flashcard** (`html/index.html`): displays vocabulary cards. Choose a lesson, flip the card to see the meaning, and use `Prev`/`Next` to navigate.
- **Quiz** (`html/quiz.html`): a multiple-choice test. Select a lesson and question type to switch between Vietnamese/English and Kana/Kanji.

## Usage
1. Download this repository or open it via GitHub Pages.
2. Open `html/index.html` in your browser to study with flashcards.
3. Open `html/quiz.html` in your browser to take the quiz.
4. Vocabulary data lives in the `data/` directory (PDF, Excel).

## Structure
- `html/` contains the main HTML pages.
- `css/` holds the stylesheets.
- `js/` has the JavaScript code.
- `data/` stores vocabulary resources.

Any modern browser with JavaScript enabled is sufficient; no additional setup is required.
